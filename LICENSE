RATIONALE

Why This License Exists:

1. Built on free resources
   - We use public specifications
   - We study open source code
   - We learn from community work
   - What was given freely, must remain free

2. Accessibility matters
   - Students can't always afford software
   - Developing countries need access
   - Hobbyists deserve good tools
   - Everyone should have opportunity

3. Community over commerce
   - We profit from 2 paid products only
   - Everything else is free
   - If we don't profit from it, no one should
   - Fair and ethical

The Problem We're Solving:

We've observed companies:
  • Fork free/open source software
  • Add minimal "enterprise features"
  • Charge significant fees
  • Profit from community work

BarrerSoftware will not allow this exploitation of free software.

ENFORCEMENT

Violations (particularly commercialization) will result in:

1. Public disclosure
   - Violator name published
   - Violation details shared
   - Community warned

2. Legal action
   - Immediate cease and desist
   - Injunction to stop distribution
   - Recovery of all profits made
   - Legal fees paid by violator

3. Permanent ban
   - Excluded from BarrerSoftware ecosystem
   - No future license grants
   - Community blacklist

Zero tolerance policy.

CLARIFICATION ON SERVICES

Licensee may charge for services related to the Software (including but not 
limited to technical support, installation, training, integration, and 
consulting) provided that the Software itself remains free of charge and the 
service fees are clearly for labor and expertise, not for software licensing.

ATTRIBUTION AND COPYRIGHT NOTICE

    and derivative works;

Subject to the terms herein, Licensor grants Licensee a perpetual, worldwide, 
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free patent license to make, have made, use, 
offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software, where such license 
applies only to those patent claims licensable by Licensor that are necessarily 
infringed by their contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
contribution(s) with the Software.

If Licensee institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Software or a 
contribution incorporated within the Software constitutes direct or contributory 
patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to Licensee under this 
License for that Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is 
filed.

  • Remain licensed under this License or a compatible license that prohibits 
    commercialization;
  • Remain free of charge in perpetuity;

WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS 
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER 
PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, 
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

enforceable and valid, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force 
and effect.
