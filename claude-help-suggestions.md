╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  LSW - Linux Subsystem for Windows                          ║
║  Run Windows programs on Linux (simple!)                    ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

👋 HELLO! WELCOME TO LSW!

If this is your first time, don't worry - it's super simple.
LSW lets you run Windows programs (.exe files) on Linux.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 QUICK START (Get Running in 30 Seconds)

Want to run a Windows program? Just type:

  lsw --launch yourprogram.exe

That's it! LSW will automatically:
  • Figure out what Windows version the program needs
  • Load the right libraries
  • Run your program

Example:
  lsw --launch notepad.exe
  lsw --launch /mnt/c/Games/game.exe

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📖 MAIN COMMANDS (The Important Ones)

These are the main things you can do with LSW:

  --launch [file]
    Run a Windows program
    Example: lsw --launch app.exe
    
  --install [file]
    Install Windows software (MSI files)
    Example: lsw --install setup.msi
    
  --list
    See what Windows programs you've installed
    Example: lsw --list
    
  --help
    Show this helpful guide (you're reading it!)
    
  --version
    Check what version of LSW you're running

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚙️  EXTRA OPTIONS (When You Need More Control)

These go AFTER your main command to change how it works:

  -version [windows-version]
    Force a specific Windows version
    Options: xp, vista, win7, win10, win11
    Example: lsw --launch oldgame.exe -version xp
    
    Why use this? Some old programs need old Windows versions.
    
  -debug
    See detailed information (helpful when things go wrong)
    Example: lsw --launch app.exe -debug
    
    Why use this? To see what's happening behind the scenes.
    
  -silent
    Don't ask questions, just do it
    Example: lsw --install app.msi -silent
    
    Why use this? For automated installations.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 COMMON QUESTIONS

Q: Where are my Windows files?
A: Your C: drive is at /mnt/c
   Your D: drive is at /mnt/d
   (Same as WSL if you've used that!)

Q: My program won't run!
A: Try adding -debug to see what's wrong:
   lsw --launch app.exe -debug
   
Q: Can I run games?
A: Yes! Try: lsw --launch game.exe -version win7

Q: How do I install software?
A: Use: lsw --install setup.msi

Q: Something's broken, help!

Run an old XP program:
  lsw --launch oldapp.exe -version xp

Install software:
  lsw --install setup.msi

See what's installed:
  lsw --list

Debug a problem:
  lsw --launch broken.exe -debug

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 COMMAND PATTERN (Quick Reference)

  lsw --[what-to-do] [file] -[how-to-do-it]
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      Main action   Target  Options
      (use --)             (use -)

  Visual tip: 
    -- (two dashes) = main command
    -  (one dash)   = extra options

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Remember: LSW is designed to be simple!

## **Specific Command Help:**

```
$ lsw --help --launch

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  LSW --launch Command                                        ║
║  Run Windows programs on Linux                               ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

📖 WHAT DOES THIS DO?

The --launch command runs Windows programs (.exe files) on Linux.
It's like double-clicking an .exe file on Windows, but from Linux!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 BASIC USAGE

Simplest form (LSW auto-detects everything):
  lsw --launch yourprogram.exe

With full path:
  lsw --launch /mnt/c/Program\ Files/App/program.exe

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚙️  OPTIONS YOU CAN USE

-version [windows-version]
  Tell LSW which Windows version to pretend to be
  
  Options: xp, vista, win7, win8, win10, win11
  
  Example: lsw --launch oldgame.exe -version xp
  
  When to use:
    • Old programs that need old Windows (use xp or win7)
    • New programs (usually auto-detect works fine)
    • Program says "Requires Windows 7" (use -version win7)

-debug
  Show detailed information about what's happening
  
  Example: lsw --launch app.exe -debug
  
  When to use:
    • Program won't start (see what's wrong)
    • Curious about what LSW is doing
    • Reporting a bug (include this output!)

-verbose
  Even MORE detailed information than -debug
  
  Example: lsw --launch app.exe -verbose
  
  When to use:
    • Really deep debugging
    • Developer-level troubleshooting

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES

Run Notepad:
  lsw --launch notepad.exe

Run a game that needs Windows XP:
  lsw --launch /mnt/c/Games/OldGame.exe -version xp

Debug why a program won't start:
  lsw --launch broken.exe -debug

Run a program from anywhere:
  cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/Downloads
  lsw --launch installer.exe

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🤔 TROUBLESHOOTING

Problem: "File not found"
Solution: Use the full path to your .exe file
  Example: lsw --launch /mnt/c/path/to/file.exe

Problem: Program won't start
Solution: Try with -debug to see what's wrong
  Example: lsw --launch app.exe -debug

Problem: Program says "wrong Windows version"
Solution: Specify the version it needs
  Example: lsw --launch app.exe -version win7

## **The Glossary in Help:**

```
$ lsw --help --glossary

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  LSW Glossary - Terms Explained Simply                      ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Don't worry if these terms are new - we'll explain everything!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

.exe (Executable)
  A Windows program file
  
  Example: notepad.exe, game.exe
  
  What it means for you:
    These are the files you double-click on Windows to run programs.
    LSW lets you run these on Linux!

.msi (Microsoft Installer)
  A Windows installation package
  
  Example: setup.msi, installer.msi
  
  What it means for you:
    These install programs on Windows. LSW can install them too!
    Use: lsw --install setup.msi

C: drive
  Windows' main hard drive letter
  
  On LSW: Located at /mnt/c
  
  What it means for you:
    When Windows programs look for C:\file.txt,
    LSW finds it at /mnt/c/file.txt
    
    This is just like WSL if you've used that!

Windows version (xp, win7, win10, etc.)
  Which version of Windows to pretend to be
  
  Example: -version win7
  
  What it means for you:
    Some old programs need old Windows versions.
    Use -version to tell LSW which version to pretend to be.

Debug mode
  Show detailed information about what's happening
  
  Example: -debug
  
  What it means for you:
    When something doesn't work, use -debug to see why.
    Helpful for troubleshooting!
